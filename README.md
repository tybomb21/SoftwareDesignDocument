The Gaming room Software Design Document
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

For this project I was given a client called The Gaming Room.  They wanted me to design a game called Win, Lose, or Draw!  This game needed the ability to run across multiple different platforms and host multiple users at the same time.
  I believe I pointed out the main similarities and differences between each platform, while explaining why I chose the Windows platform to develop the application on, really well.  
  While working through the Design document I found that some simple research can lead you to complex discoveries.  Following simple guidelines can really broaden your knowledge if you know what you are looking for.
  If I could go back and spend more time on one section of this document I would change the table for Development Requirements. I would reorganize it into an easier to read file or document, and go more in depth with explanation of server side versus client side development.
  I took the users needs as they were.  If a user wants a specific design or function, we as developers have to give them what they want. Of course we can optimize their ideas and make them more efficient for everyone, but we need to address the users needs becasue they are the reason we are designing the application.
  In the future I would design a similar template for myself and my team to use.  Using a document to track progress helps the dev team and the client because it is a visual record of progress. While designing the software document, or the software in general, i would keep the agile team in the loop and stay transparent.  Communication throughout this process is key for proper and timely development. User/client interaction with the Product Owner will directly impact the software document and design process, so its crucial to stay up to date and on the same page as a team.
